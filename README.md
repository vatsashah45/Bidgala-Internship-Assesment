# Bidgala-Internship-Assesment

This was the final part of my assesment for an internship at Bidgala(https://bidgala.com/).


Created a simple web interface that can search OMDB API for movies.

Requirements 
    •    Search OMDB and display the results (only movies, not TV shows) - should display the  image and movie title at the very least 
    •    Add a movie to your watchlist 
    •    Delete a movie from your watchlist  
    •    View your watchlist  
    •    If a search result movie has already been added, disable its add button.
